The input folder contains .cel files of ontologies that are to be translated.

The output folder contains intermittent results of the parsing process. 

In the spassInput folder you will find the parsed .dfg file.

I used the parser in the way that I set the variable "ontology" you will find in the Main.java file to the file name of the file 
I wanted to translate. You will find further comments and documentation in the Main.java file
